### About Me
My name is Tom Kusak and I am rising senior computer science student at the University of Notre Dame.

### Projects
Currently I am working on a data science final - using machine learning to answer the question: can we predict whether a given flight will be delayed? ([flight_delays](https://github.com/tkusak27/flight_delays))
